# SWIM (Surface Water IMputation) Classification Framework

This repository contains code, examples, and validation data to reproduce the findings of the 2021 paper by Labuzzetta et al. (2021) "A submonthly surface water classification framework via gap-fill imputation and random forest classifiers of Landsat imagery." Most importantly, the `framework` directory contains the code necessary to download and process data for your own region of interest if you would like to use the SWIM framework for your own work.

### How to navigate this repository:

1. In the `framework` directory, see the README file to learn "How to SWIM"

2. In the `case_studies` directory, find the data and scripts for the Colorado River, Devil's Lake, and New Orleans case studies presented in Labuzetta et al. (2021). 

3. In the `validation` directory, find the Google Earth Engine script and validation geometries for the validation study presented in Labuzzetta et al. (2021).


### Version Release History:

Code from the version 1.0 release of this repository follows the methodology presented in Labuzzetta et al. (2021). Please be sure to refer to this v1.0 if your goal is to reproduce the results of our published research. Releases after v1.0 improve upon the published framework and will not neccesarily produce the same results or follow the same methodology. Version release history is detailed below.
